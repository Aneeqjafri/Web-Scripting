✅ **Live Vote Count** – Instantly updates vote totals in real-time

- 💅 **CSS / Bootstrap** – For styling  
- 🔢 **React State Management (useState)** – To handle vote counts  
- 🌐 **GitHub Pages** – For hosting

## 🧩 How It Works

1. Each candidate starts with **0 votes**.  
2. When a user clicks **Vote**, the candidate’s vote count increases by 1.  
3. The user cannot vote again — ensuring fair voting.  
4. The total is updated **live** on the screen.
